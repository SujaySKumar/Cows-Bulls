# Cows-Bulls
This is a program to play the game of Cows and Bulls using a number of 4 digits.
This program sends a 4 digit number to a server as a "guess".
If a digit in the number guessed matches with a digit in the number being guessed but the position doesn't match,
then it becomes a cow.
If both the position and the digit matches, it becomes a bull.
The server in turn sends back two numbers. The first one being the number of bulls and
the second one being the number of cows.Based on this data, the number that is stored in the server will be guessed correctly.
Repetition of numbers is not allowed
